Bare Metal Route

Paperless runs on linux only. The following procedure has been tested on a minimal installation of Debian/Buster, which is the current stable release at the time of writing. Windows is not and will never be supported.

Paperless requires Python 3. At this time, 3.9 - 3.11 are tested versions. Newer versions may work, but some dependencies may not fully support newer versions. Support for older Python versions may be dropped as they reach end of life or as newer versions are released, dependency support is confirmed, etc.
